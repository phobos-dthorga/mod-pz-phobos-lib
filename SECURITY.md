## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a bug that could be exploited in multiplayer (item duplication,
remote code execution via Lua, sandbox escape, etc.), please report it
privately rather than opening a public issue.

**How to report:**
- Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-managing-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature on this repository

We will acknowledge reports within 7 days and aim to patch confirmed
vulnerabilities in the next release.
